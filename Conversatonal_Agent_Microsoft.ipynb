            "hi , this is sarah from the microsoft community. lets see if we can get your problem resolved. since the computer already comes with a valid license for windows 7, i would just perform a factory reset and set it up with a new user account. new computers that come preinstalled with windows often have what is called a recovery partition. this is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. to access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing a function key. this can be either f1, f2, f9, f10, f11, f12 or even del or tab key. consult the owners manual that came with your pc for instructions about how to reinstall windows. this is how the recovery partition is accessed for the most popular makes.. for dell, press ctrl + f11 directly after powering up the unit for hp, press f11 directly after powering up the unit for lg, press f11 directly after powering up the unit for toshiba, press and hold '0' before and during the power up for acer, press and hold alt + f10 as soon as you see the logo for asus, press f9 as soon as you see the asus logo. for samsung, press f4 at power up.. for fujitsu, press the f8 key repeatedly directly after powering up for advent, restart your computer. then press f10 repeatedly until the message \"starting system recovery\" is displayed for sony vaio, restart and press \"f8\" or \"f10\" repeatedly until the \"advanced boot options\" screen appears. if you want to run something newer than windows 7, you might still be able to get windows 10 for free: https://www.groovypost.com/howto/download-windows-10-free/ best, andresarah windows insider mvp mvp-windows and devices for it http://twitter.com/adacosta\n",
